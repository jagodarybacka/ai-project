# AI project
Project for Artificial Intelligence class


Algorithms used in this project:

- **A*** for finding path between two given points on map
- **Simulated Annealing** for finding shortest path between multiple points - Traveling Salesman Problem. Short description of this alghoritm can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sV9YvN7XzmcPCVruYW_NjdFqBlr5awEWu9EYQ2HTEXM/edit?usp=sharing) 
- **Decisive trees** for creating the list of houses that the truck will visit. 
- **Genetic algorithm** for finding shortest path betweeen multiple points.
- **ID3 algorytm** for sorting rubbish with known features.
